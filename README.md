  If you need to compile SCSS styles to CSS, run the following command:

Copy code

- Linter
  To ensure that we maintain clean and consistent code, we use ESLint as a linter. You can run it with the following command:

Copy code

The linter will check all JavaScript files and display any issues or warnings related to syntax and code style.

- Formatter
  We keep the code consistently formatted using Prettier. If you want to automatically format the files, run the following command:

This will apply the formatting rules set by Prettier to the JavaScript files and adjust them according to conventions.
