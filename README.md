# Project Name

Brief description or introduction of the project.

- Installation
  To get started with the project, follow these steps to install the dependencies:

Copy code

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install all the necessary dependencies for the project.

- Changing Styles
  If you need to compile SCSS styles to CSS, run the following command:

Copy code

```bash
npm run sass
```

This command will compile the SCSS files in the styles directory and generate the corresponding CSS files.

- Linter
  To ensure that we maintain clean and consistent code, we use ESLint as a linter. You can run it with the following command:

Copy code

```bash
npm run lint
```

The linter will check all JavaScript files and display any issues or warnings related to syntax and code style.

- Formatter
  We keep the code consistently formatted using Prettier. If you want to automatically format the files, run the following command:

Copy code

```bash
npm run format
```

This will apply the formatting rules set by Prettier to the JavaScript files and adjust them according to conventions.
